# UHex
Just a simple encode/decode from utf-8 Unicode to hex


# Usage
when it asks for input for anything you can also use other things like for decode you could do Decode, D, d, decode

When encoding you can choose to have the hex encoded with the 0x in front, if you do so it will also add spaces inbetween each character
